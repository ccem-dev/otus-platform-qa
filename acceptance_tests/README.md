# Acceptance tests on Otus

### Files organization

 * ```./code``` : class and library code support for testing
 
   * ```/classes``` : page element generic classes
   
   * ```/handlers``` : "static" classes for specific things needed in all tests
   
   * ```/otus``` : classes and library for otus tests
     * ```/classes```
     * ```/lib.js```
     
   * ```/otus-studio``` : classes and library for otus-studio tests
     * ```/classes```
     * ```/lib.js```
     
   * ```./mainConstants.js``` : all the configuration constants (browser, timeout, paths) for all tests
   
   * ```./utils.js``` : library with functions called in test files
   
 * ```./data``` : (input) files for tests (see [pattern for otus studio data files](./data/otus-studio/README.md))
 
 * ```./downloads``` : download directory, created by makefile
 
 * ```./output``` : directory, created by makefile, for output like screenshots and test results
 
 * ```./tests``` : directory with the test files, organized by the platform directory (which contains a template.js file as an example)
 
 * ```./jest.config.js``` : "main file" - config file, including test files path array (```testMatch``` attribute)
 


### Environment

At first use, just run ``` make ``` to prepare everything and run tests (defined in jest.config).

To reinstall (deleting files generated by 'npm install'), run ``` make reinstall```.

### Run

For run all tests: ```make run```.


### Results

At the end of the run, files will be generated in ```output/test_result```, one for each test file and with the same name:

 * ```<test file name>-result.txt``` if all test passed
 * ```<test file name>-fails.txt``` if same test fail
